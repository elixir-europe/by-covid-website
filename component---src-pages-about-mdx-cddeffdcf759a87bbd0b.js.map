The project will further accelerate access to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and linking patient and research data.`}</p>\n      <p>{`To ensure interoperability of national and global efforts, BY-COVID will enable federated data analysis compliant with data protection regulations, harmonise and manage metadata and sample identifiers, and facilitate long-term cataloguing.`}</p>\n      <p>{`BY-COVID will build on the One-Health approach, exploit and contribute to the European Open Science Cloud and work closely with the ISIDORe project funded through HORIZON Europe.`}</p>\n      <p>{`The project will integrate established national and European infrastructures with ELIXIR, BBMRI, ECRIN, PHIRI and CESSDA. It will build on existing efforts, such as the COVID-19 Data Platform and the Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory project (VEO), maximising efficiency. It will also develop synergies with the European Health Data Space.`}</p>\n      <p>{`In an unprecedented and unique interdisciplinary effort, BY-COVID will bring together 55 partners from 19 countries and stakeholders from the biomedical field, hospitals, public health, social sciences and humanities.\nUltimately, it will improve European readiness for future pandemics, enhance genomic surveillance and rapid-response capabilities. In addition, BY-COVID serves as a demonstrator of interdisciplinary work across country borders. The project's outputs will allow scientists across multiple domains, including SMEs and industry, to access varied data with the potential to generate new knowledge on infectious diseases.`}</p>\n      <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZdYWb6HXc849RTER2p5IAzjFXSAojjab_tku9q1GX6M/edit#\"\n        }}>{`Complete project summary`}</a>{`  (PDF)`}</p>\n      {\n        /* BY-COVID IN NUMBERS */\n      }\n      <Circles circlesTitle=\"BY-COVID in numbers\" circle1=\"Euros\" circle1Value=\"12M\" circle2=\"Partners\" circle2Value=\"53\" circle3=\"Countries\" circle3Value=\"20\" circle4=\"Months\" circle4Value=\"36\" mdxType=\"Circles\" />\n    </div>\n    {\n      /* OBJECTIVES */\n    }\n    <Numbers numbersTitle=\"Objectives\" one=\"Enable storage, sharing, access, analysis and processing of research data and other digital research objects from outbreak research.\" two=\"Mobilise and expose viral and human infectious disease data from national centres.\" three=\"Link FAIR data and metadata on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.\" four=\"Develop digital tools and data analytics for pandemic and outbreak preparedness, including tracking genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 and identifying new variants of concern.\" five=\"Contribute to the Horizon Europe European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Partnership & European Health Data Space (EHDS).\" mdxType=\"Numbers\" />\n    {\n      /* PROJECT STRUCTURE */\n    }\n    <BoxGrid boxGridTitle=\"Project structure\"\n    /*\n    * WP1\n    */\n    box1Title=\"WP1: Support for virological analyses in emerging disease outbreaks\" box1Description=\"Work Package 1 will establish and improve SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs that, with a globally comprehensive viral sequence and normative variation data sets, provide the foundation for linking genomic surveillance with heterogeneous data across domains.
