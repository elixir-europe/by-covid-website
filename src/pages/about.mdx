<h2 class="mt-1">Project summary</h2>

BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) aims to provide comprehensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases across scientific, medical, public health and policy domains. It will strongly emphasise mobilising raw viral sequences, helping to identify and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The project will further accelerate access to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and linking patient and research data.

To ensure interoperability of national and global efforts, BY-COVID will enable federated data analysis compliant with data protection regulations, harmonise and manage metadata and sample identifiers, and facilitate long-term cataloguing.

BY-COVID will build on the One-Health approach, exploit and contribute to the European Open Science Cloud and work closely with the ISIDORe project funded through HORIZON Europe.

The project will integrate established national and European infrastructures with ELIXIR, BBMRI, ECRIN, PHIRI and CESSDA. It will build on existing efforts, such as the COVID-19 Data Platform and the Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory project (VEO), maximising efficiency. It will also develop synergies with the European Health Data Space.

In an unprecedented and unique interdisciplinary effort, BY-COVID will bring together 53 partners from 19 countries and stakeholders from the biomedical field, hospitals, public health, social sciences and humanities.

Ultimately, it will improve European readiness for future pandemics, enhance genomic surveillance and rapid-response capabilities. In addition, BY-COVID serves as a demonstrator of interdisciplinary work across country borders. The project's outputs will allow scientists across multiple domains, including SMEs and industry, to access varied data with the potential to generate new knowledge on infectious diseases.

   <h2>The European COVID-19 Data Platform</h2>

Rapid and open sharing of data greatly accelerates research and discovery, which is essential to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Commission, EMBLâ€™s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and ELIXIR, together with EU Member States and other research partners, operate a dedicated European COVID-19 Data Platform. This Platform enables the rapid collection and comprehensive data sharing of available research data from different sources for the European and global research communities.

The European COVID-19 Data Platform consists of three connected components:

 1. **[SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/data-hubs):** can be used to organise SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data at national, regional and institute levels. Upon release, this data can then be openly shared with the global research community via the COVID-19 Data Portal.

 2. **[Federated European Genome-phenome Archive](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/federated-ega):** provides secure, controlled access sharing of sensitive patient and COVID-19 research data.

 3. **[COVID-19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/):**  brings together tools and SARS-CoV-2 viral and host datasets spanning genomics, proteins, imaging, drug compounds and publications, enabling researchers to access and analyse integrated COVID-19 data easily.

The design of the BY-COVID project rests on this foundation, aiming to connect well-established data resources and deliver access to heterogeneous, yet interlinked and organised data, across domains and jurisdictions via the COVID-19 Data Platform components. Over the course of the project, emerging [national data portals](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/partners) will be linked to the COVID-19 Data Platform, thus establishing a federated digital space for infectious disease data.

<h3>Public</h3>

We will work with patient organisations and the broader public so that people are aware of the project and can provide feedback on it. In particular, we will be asking for feedback on the ethical, social and legal aspects of opening access to infectious disease data across Europe.

We will also produce materials such as infographics and cartoons on what FAIR data is (i.e. data that is **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable). These materials will outline the work of the project, and show how making data FAIR will help us combat disease. The materials will also include a resource pack for high school teachers, to educate high school students about BY-COVID and FAIR data. We will publish a report on the effectiveness of these public engagement activities.

<button class="btn btn-primary" onClick={()=>{navigate("/usecases")}}>For citizens</button>

<h3 class = "pt-4">Industry</h3>

We aim to map COVID-related activities in industry, and build a community of specialists to discuss visionary ideas, challenges and solutions in the area of COVID and infectious diseases.

By doing this, we would like to demonstrate the importance of FAIR open data for the development of medicines, diagnostic tests and other products.
Our plan is to organise access days, aim days, Innovation and SME Forums, and publish use cases and reports describing the industry ecosystem in COVID and infectious diseases.

If you want to be part of this community or to help us map the industry community and engage in our upcoming activities, please fill in our survey.

<button class="btn btn-primary" onClick={()=>{navigate("https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/ZXF6SCV")}}>Take the industry survey</button>

<h3 class="pt-5">Funders</h3>

Showcasing the impact of the project to funding organisations is key to the continued investment in the infrastructure being developed by BY-COVID. We are planning two large stakeholder events to communicate the outputs of the project, and the value of open infectious disease data. These events will be aimed at funders and policy-makers, including the European Commission, national EOSC (European Open Science Cloud) representatives, and relevant EU agencies.

We will further demonstrate the importance of FAIR COVID-19 and other infectious disease data and software to support innovation in academia and industry.
