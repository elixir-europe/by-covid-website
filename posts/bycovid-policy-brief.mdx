The BY-COVID project has published a policy brief summarising learnings and policy recommendations to support pandemic preparedness.

Six key takeaways have been identified for policymakers:

* Place open data at the heart of national pandemic preparedness plans (aligned with the ERA vs Corona Action Plan)

* Encourage consortia and projects generating data to deposit their data in the public domain, through research infrastructures and databases such as the European COVID-19 Data Platform 

* Provide adequate support for national data hubs and other infrastructure at the local level

* Ensure investments across life sciences domains to maintain and reuse community-driven knowledge sharing platforms to inform future projects and foster links with research infrastructure facilities

* Enable research infrastructure led investments in technologies and their on-going adaptation to specific requirements for making infectious diseases data open and accessible to everyone

* Provide adequate training to foster the adoption of dedicated research tools (e.g. WorkFlowHub, RoCrate, FAIRsharing), data sharing practices, and FAIR and metadata creation.
