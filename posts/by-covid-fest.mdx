The BY-COVID Fest is a face to face event that will host two parallel but strongly connected streams on 23-25 January 2024 in the [Hotel Amalia](https://www.amaliahotels.com/athens/hotel/) in Athens, Greece. 

The training stream on <strong>Data sharing and reuse under GDPR</strong> will feature lectures from experts, real-case and demo sessions, and workshops where participants can reflect on and collect experiences, issues and solutions. It aims to empower data users and producers to become confident in submitting or using sensitive data, express their questions and issues to professionals in their institutions, and find solutions for their sensitive data issues.

The <strong>IDTk contentathon</strong> stream will bring together all those willing to contribute to the Infectious Disease Toolkit ([IDTk](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/)) pages, especially the attendees of the <strong>Data sharing and reuse under GDPR</strong> session but not only. Participants will also include IDTk editors, BY-COVID partners, sibling project partners, etc. The <strong>contentathon</strong> participants will contribute to writing general guidelines for data handling, analysis and visualisations in the context of infectious diseases. We are particularly looking forward to the contributions of our colleagues working with Socioeconomic data, but all the others are welcome to participate.
