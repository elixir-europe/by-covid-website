The Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory (VEO) has published its ninth report on SARS-Cov-2 sequence data submitted to the European COVID-19 Data Portal. 
 
The data in the report include more than 1,876,126 viral raw read sets from 80 countries. The variant nomenclature has been updated, and tables on countries depositing data on VOC and VOI have been included. The variant calling workflow for the Oxford Nanopore data has been implemented and 83,041 samples of the total 172,654 have been processed so far.
 
VEO creates reports that summarise the mobilisation and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data submitted to the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/) in the context of the [VEO project](https://www.veo-europe.eu). The project aims to develop tools and data analytics for pandemic and outbreak preparedness. VEO data analysis is applied to open data shared through our platform and complement analysis presented upon other data sharing platforms.
