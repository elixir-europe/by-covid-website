It will be free, online, self-paced, and choose-your-own-adventure style e-training event. 

It will feature all the content of previous editions, plus lots more! This includes training for Admins, Developers, and Scientists and will range from Genomisc, and Climate Science to Material Science and RDM. The EOSC [EuroScienceGateway](https://eurosciencegateway.eu/) is co-organizing this event and provides training infrastructure via the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu/).

The preliminary program can be found on the [course website](https://gxy.io/smorgasbord3). (Several modules are still in development, so check back regularly for the updated program!)
