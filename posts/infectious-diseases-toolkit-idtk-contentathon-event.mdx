<hr />

The **[Infectious Diseases Toolkit](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/) (IDTk)** aims to offer guidelines and examples on managing, analysing and visualising infectious diseases data. It has been designed to accommodate information from different domains, to showcase different solutions, and to expose national resources. It is being developed as part of the [BY-COVID project](https://by-covid.eu/).

To catalyse the addition of content to the toolkit, we are organising a Contentathon involving both BY-COVID and external partners. We aim to bring together experts from various fields who have dealt with pandemics over the last few years, and who are interested in capturing all the innovative solutions and best practices that have been used to tackle infectious diseases outbreaks.

The Contentathon will be three days of face-to-face interaction between the IDTk editors and content contributors. During the event, a group of editors who are familiar with adding content to the IDTk will assist you in adding your own content. You can see [here](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/about/editorial-board) the members of the editorial board.

While we encourage face-to-face participation, we understand that not everyone is able to travel for the Contentathon. Therefore, we will also offer short support sessions over Zoom for those who are unable to attend in person.

The goal of the event is to gather content that will help enhance infectious diseases outbreak preparedness. You will be acknowledged for your contribution at the bottom of the relevant page(s), and we hope also that you will get a chance to meet people who work in similar domains to yourself to exchange ideas.

For events, the Infectious Diseases Toolkit team and contributors abide by the [ELIXIR Code of Conduct of events](https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct).
