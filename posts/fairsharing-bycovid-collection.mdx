The COVID-19 Data Portal makes it possible for researchers to access and integrate a broad range of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 data. BY-COVID has developed tools, workflows, documentation and training to support the incorporation of additional resources from many different research disciplines. 

A key initial step involves registering data sources and uploading their key characteristics to FAIRsharing. A cross-disciplinary resource that maps and interlinks databases, standards and policies, FAIRsharing enables efficient onboarding of new data sources and a means to ensure these are more discoverable in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) ecosystem.

The BY-COVID FAIRsharing Collection is a catalogue and <a href="https://fairsharing.org/graph/3773" target="_blank">knowledge graph</a> data sources and their characteristics, including access terms, protocols and standards used to represent the data and metadata (Figure 1). The Collection currently contains 20 data sources (Table 1), developed by BY-COVID members, from social science and humanities, health and clinical data, images, genomic and phenotypic data and chemical biology.

Making a range of infectious disease data sources widely discoverable, accessible and interoperable is important for research and innovation, which is increasingly multidisciplinary in nature. For example, pathogen research is accelerated by the availability of data from clinical trials, biobanks, behavioural and socioeconomic studies, particularly if the data is combined with host and pathogen omics information. Many of these data types, for example clinical records or bioactivity data, may contain high resolution images, the availability of which extends the potential research questions which can be explored.

Multidisciplinary data is also critical for public health decision-making, where policy questions are complex and evidence from biomolecular research, clinical studies and social sciences must be taken into account. One lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic was that data-driven decision-making needs high quality, real-time data from many research disciplines and geographic areas in an integrated format. The BY-COVID project is building on these learnings and creating solutions for COVID-19 that can be extended to other pathogens. Resources like the COVID-19 Data Portal and FAIRsharing are pivotal to meet these goals.

The launch of the FAIRsharing BY-COVID Collection, which will grow progressively, marks an important step in the maturation of the BY-COVID project. Datasets from these data sources will now be incorporated into the COVID-19 Data Portal, providing access to heterogeneous, yet interlinked and organised data, across domains. Over the course of the project, emerging national data portals will be registered in FAIRsharing and linked to the COVID-19 Data Platform, building a federated digital space for infectious disease data.
