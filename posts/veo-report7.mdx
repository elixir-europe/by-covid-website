VEO submits the [14th report](https://www.veo-europe.eu/-/media/sites/veo-europe/library/veo-covid-19-variants-report-14-final.pdf?la=da&hash=D2E26C367CA877E193F21EA9351764F5F4670E73) on mutations and variation in publicly shared SARS-CoV-2 raw sequencing data.

In its 14th report to the European Commission, VEO Consortium members summarize mobilisation and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data submitted to the European COVID-19 Data Portal in the context of the VEO project, which aims to develop tools and data analytics for pandemic and outbreak preparedness.

**Summary**:

* Update on mobilisation of raw reads, now totaling sequencing datasets from 5,784,221 viral raw read sets from 96 countries, a 5.1% increase since the previous report.
* The variant calling workflow for the Illumina data has been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform. In total, 274,693 Illumina and 22,699 Oxford Nanopore samples have been processed in the period since the last report.
* In line with observations elsewhere, the number of new datasets submitted appears to be slowing down as expected given the phase of the pandemic, where the amount of testing and the sequencing effort have been reduced in many countries.
* In line with the phase of the pandemic, this report will move to quarterly updates.
