Are you familiar with metadata, but still feel lost with regards to the different ontologies and vocabularies? This is your chance to better understand what it is all about! 

Join us for a short, hands-on workshop where you will discover the importance and benefits of metadata. We will start with the basics and several illustrations, and by the end of it, even a presentation from a metadata specialist will sound crystal clear.

Don't miss out on this opportunity!

**Who should attend?**

Researchers, data analysts and anyone interested in better understanding what metadata is and its importance.
