The VEO has published its [12th report](https://www.veo-europe.eu/-/media/sites/veo-europe/library/veo-covid-19-variants-report-12-final.pdf) on the SARS-Cov-2 sequence data submitted to the European COVID-19 Data Portal.
 
The report was released on 20 July 2022, and summarises the mobilisation and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data submitted to the European COVID-19 Data Portal in the context of the [VEO project](https://www.veo-europe.eu/).  The VEO (Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory) project aims to develop tools and data analytics for pandemic and outbreak preparedness.
 
The following VEO Consortium members contributed to the report: Erasmus Medical Center, Eötvös Loránd University, EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, and Technical University of Denmark.
