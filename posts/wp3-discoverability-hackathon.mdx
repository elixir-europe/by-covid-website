**Date of the event:** 8 February 2023, 14:00-16:00 CET
 
In this Hackathon participants will learn how to provide a metadata file for making content of a data resource discoverable through the [COVID-19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/). The Portal is a central, high level entry point of COVID-19 related knowledge across a broad range of domains, from molecular biology via clinical data to social sciences, to connect information across the EOSC ecosystem as well as with international resources. Beyond Covid, the experience from the COVID-19 Data Portal will also be used to prepare for rapid response to potential future pandemic scenarios.

Benefits of adding your data to the COVID-19 Data Portal include:
* Visibility for your data resource
* Experience in multi-domain metadata integration
* Increased support for general pandemic preparedness and response 

**Who should attend?**
Technical representatives of public data resources with content related to Covid-19 or the larger pandemic preparedness context. 

We will provide a quick overview of the principles, and then will work on concrete examples to provide metadata for a resource in the required format. Thus, some familiarity with generating data reports, and general metadata principles would be helpful. Participation in the previous [Discoverability hackathon](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YfCyIhqhJWpVC-kx_mKKz1CtSiDAkEOB?usp=share_link) is not required, the workshop is open to all interested potential content providers. 


**Recommended Preparation**
1. Register your data source (database, repository, knowledgebase) in FAIRsharing; see instructions by WP2. 
2. Study the BY-COVID [WP3 Metadata documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXGhGHm5ErqmLEOtjOAHehLKPRYSOfBcGWFeoAsx58Y/edit#gid=0)
3. We invite you to test your metadata with this [validator](https://www.omicsdi.org/validate) before the hackathon.
