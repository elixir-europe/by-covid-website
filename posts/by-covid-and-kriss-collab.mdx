BY-COVID’s global reach is set to be expanded through a collaboration with the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). 

The partnership enables BY-COVID to further support the delivery of a globally comprehensive dataset of SARS-CoV-2 sequence variations through the COVID-19 Data Portal,  which is underpinned by the  European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) the European Variation Archive (EVA).

As a result of the agreement, KRISS will work to encourage the deposition of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from Korean institutes to the ENA, enabling data to flow from South Korea to the COVID-19 Data Platform. KRISS will also be supported by BY-COVID in setting up a National COVID-19 Data Portal, following the example of the [COVID-19 Data Portal JAPAN](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/partners?activeTab=National%20Data%20Portals).

The signing of the collaboration agreement supports the standardisation of biological data generated or acquired by KRISS, including viral whole genome data, and its compatibility with international databases. It also provides scope for the exchange of researchers between BY-COVID project participants.

The collaboration will contribute to the number of national centres and countries connecting to the COVID-19 Data Portal and enhance the availability of BY-COVID project data to researchers worldwide for use in related research.


## About BY-COVID

The BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) project aims to provide comprehensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases across scientific, medical, public health and policy domains. With 53 partners from 19 countries, it supports the mobilisation of raw viral sequences, helping to identify and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The project accelerates access to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and supports the linking patient and research data.

## About KRISS

The Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) is the national measurement standards laboratory for the Republic of Korea. It is a government-funded institute responsible for providing national measurement standards and advancing measurement technologies. KRISS also plays a pivotal role in upgrading Korea’s main industries to the global level by research, development and dissemination of measurement science and technology.
