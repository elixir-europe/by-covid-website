Computer scientists and developers from BY-COVID involved in [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu) have published new data and analysis methods on the new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, [Omicron](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern). Throughout the pandemic, Galaxy Europe has provided easy-to-use computational analysis pipelines for researchers to easily analyse COVID-19 related data. 

Using open access data on the Omicron variant, the team at Galaxy Europe ran their analysis and showed the evolution of the Omicron variant through itâ€™s mutational pattern and by comparison of 68 different samples. By making their analysis pipeline public and open to everyone, it means that any researcher can quickly repeat the analysis with new data and also makes it easy to compare data between locations, variants and time-points.  

Galaxy Europe are project partners of the BY-COVID project, this work was completed as part of the BY-COVID [Work Package 4](https://by-covid.org/about#structure) "Connecting the COVID-19 Data Platform to analysis tools and local portals".
