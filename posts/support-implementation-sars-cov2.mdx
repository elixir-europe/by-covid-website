** Closing date: 1 September 2023 17:00 CET **

The BY-COVID project has an open call for proposals to support the implementation of additional SARS-CoV-2 data hubs to increase the flow of viral sequence data into the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), in line with open science principles. 

The call contributes to the broader ambition of creating a pan-European network for the mobilisation and analysis of pathogen data, including from SARS-CoV-2.
Applicants, individuals or consortia, may support the implementation of  data hubs through a range of activities such as:

* Training and outreach at national/regional level on informatics aspects of pathogen genomics 
* Infrastructure development - especially development of programming interfaces to provide connectivity with data hubs 
* Curation of data and metadata
* Analysis of locally generated data
* Landscaping studies to understand national and regional needs

## Who can apply

The persons or categories of persons that may receive financial support are:

* Legal entities
* A consortium consisting of several organisations can apply, but a single legal entity needs to act as a contractual partner
* Single institutions or consortia such as:
  * Academic, government or commercial entities engaged in sequence-based surveillance and outbreak investigation
  * NGOs and IGOs involved in capacity building
* Scientists, public health professionals, (bio)informatics experts, funders, educational establishments

Applicants should not be beneficiaries from the BY-COVID project and are limited to [EU and associated countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf) only. Please check the eligibility criteria for more information.
