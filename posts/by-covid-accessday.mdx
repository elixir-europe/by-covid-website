**BY-COVID industry event** - Better data management for better pandemic preparedness, disease surveillance and outbreak control

**Date of the event:** 24 January 2023, 13.00-15.00 CET
 
**Format:** 2h virtual event
 
**Purpose:** Identify opportunities for data driven innovation in infectious diseases, join a network of specialists and explore potential collaborations with the BY-COVID project.

**Target audience:** Anyone involved in openly available software or data on COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in their internal pipelines/business model from the following sectors:

* Diagnostics
* Pharma
* Biotech-/bioinformatics companies 
* Contract Research Organisation/Contract Manufacturing Organisation
* Consulting
* Medical Devices
* Hospitals/healthcare providers

​​This virtual event is organised under the EU project BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID), a project that aims to provide comprehensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases across scientific, medical, public health and policy domains. Under this initiative, we are providing a virtual space for BY-COVID partners to engage with industry communities and ensure that we can find collaborative solutions for making COVID-19 and other infectious disease data available for innovation.

## Main themes

* <strong>Repurposing data and software tools for a faster future health crisis response:</strong> How open source code and open or FAIR data were used in industry during the COVID crisis and what lessons have been learnt for the future.
* <strong>Novel technologies and innovative projects tackling global disease burden developed during the pandemic:</strong> How novel tools could improve data quality, enable efficient data collection, or build robust prediction models.
 
This webinar is the first of a series of events, and the audience will have the opportunity to **hear about examples of public-private collaborations, introduce themselves and their innovative projects through flash talks**.
