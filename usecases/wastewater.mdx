Did you know that flushing your toilet might be contributing data for research?  Wastewater from toilets has been used as a valuable tool for detecting disease hotspots in the COVID-19 pandemic. By surveying wastewater we can anticipate rates of COVID-19 related hospital admissions in specific areas or even predict future outbreaks of other diseases.

Our excrement can be seen as a dynamic record of events happening in our body, like particles of the COVID-19 virus when we are infected. This means that we can measure how much of the virus and which variants are circulating in the population, or in particular areas with a management system that maximises benefits and effectively manages risks.

** HOW IS THE DATA COLLECTED AND STORED? **

BY-COVID works with the Italian SARI project, where data in wastewater is collected approximately once or twice a week in each city in Italy. The data are then stored in databases and on dashboards in which data on wastewater surveillance data can be entered in real-time to have an up to date picture of the pandemic waves. Researchers from BY-COVID project then ensure that data extracted from wastewater samples can be used to make comparisons between different countries, answer research questions or to inform decisions such as local lockdowns or other public health measures.

** WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS? **

Wastewater analysis is an  effective tool for detection and surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks. By knowing the areas where the pathogen is most concentrated, policy responses can be better adapted.  The resources (for example databases and data analysis software) provided by BY-COVID are therefore useful for fighting the current pandemic but also for spotting  future ones.

** WHAT ARE THE RISKS WHEN WE USE THESE DATA? **

Personal data can theoretically be found in wastewater if the human DNA in the excrements is analysed. However, in this research area only data about viruses is collected, not about humans.
The BY-COVID infrastructure is set up to counter these risks: all the data that is used in the wastewater analysis is aggregated, which means that it is impossible to precisely identify the individuals behind the data.
